This is raw avr code with a a bit of arduino glue to add Corey J Fowler's CAN bus libraries. The glue causes dependencies on some of the arduino headers - you'll have to change the makefile to find them for your arduino distribution. (Sadly, it seems that the arduino directories get set up differently on different computers, so simply setting a single ARDUINO_ROOT path doesn't work.)
