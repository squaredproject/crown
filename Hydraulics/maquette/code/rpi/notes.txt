Notes on installlation
- Had to set credentials with github in order to be abe to clone the crown repo:
    git config --global credential.provider generic
- Upgraded to python 3.10, according to documentation https://allurcode.com/install-latest-version-of-python-on-raspberry-pi/
- Installed pip3 
- Installed arduino command line tools. 
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduino/arduino-cli/master/install.sh > arduino_cli_install.sh
  sh ./arduino_cli_install.sh
  <change path in .bashrc to include /home/pi/bin>
  arduino-cli config init
  arduino-cli core update-index  (installs list of available boards)
  arduino-cli board list         (shows attached boards, get fpqn for board)
  arduino-cli core install arduino:avr  (install board package)
  arduino-cli lib install mcp_can  (install can library used by this rpi sketch)
  arduino-cli compile --fbqn arduino:avr:mega maquette.ino
  arduino-cli upload -p <port> --fqbn <fqbn> <sketch>    (Important - sketch seems to be the *directory* your sketch is in. This may also do the compile)
  (see instructions at https://siytek.com/arduino-cli-raspberry-pi/)

Maquette Commands (prefixed by 'm'):
- L<towerId>. Set joint limits for tower
- D. Set debug level (? levels are 0 and 1?)
- M<mode_int>. Set mode. 0-3, OFF, FREE_PLAY, POSE, SLAVE
- s. Get status of maquette
- P. Set slave position
- C. Set center of joint (calibration)
- c. Get calibration status (is calibrated or not?)
- E. Enable/disable tower
- e<tower_id><joint-id>. Enable/disable joint
- S. Return model position (simulation)
- A. Read all joints, return analog values
